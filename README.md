Counter: a simple couting app
----

This simple app has a single button and single numeric textbox containing, initially, the number 0.
When the button is clicked, the number increases by one.
The textbox is editable, so the user can type in their own number.
The button will count from that number onwards.

# Branches
The branches just show the project in various stages.





# Exercise
Add a reset button, that resets the count to 0.
